# eth1 IP address and subnet mask are configured automatically by netkit (this is the way this node talks to the outside world)


#to access the nodes in 10.99.0.0/16  we need a route via the gateway node RouterAC
route add -net 10.99.0.0/16  gw 192.168.99.3

#to access the nodes in 172.16.99.0/24  we need a route via the gateway node RouterBC
route add -net 172.16.99.0/24  gw 192.168.99.4


#The elegant solution for accessing the WAN involves NAT(Network Address Translation) and needs just one command, and doesn't involve touching external routers
echo "prepare NAT for trafic going to WAN(eth1)::"
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth1 -j MASQUERADE

#However you can still make it work without NAT, by configuring the routing tables of the host machine(see the file 'setup-external')
