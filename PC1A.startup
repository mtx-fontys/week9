ifconfig eth0 up
/etc/init.d/networking start

#configure eth0 IP address and subnet mask
ifconfig eth0 10.99.0.1/16

#we expect the above command to also add a direct route for all the nodes in 10.99.0.0/16

#so now we only need to specify how we can access the other networks
#since all the rest of the networks are accessible through routerAC we need one more rule:
route add default gw 10.99.0.254 dev eth0
