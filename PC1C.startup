#From the perspective of PC1C the network looks like this:

#Therefore we can tell that PC1C needs
#	1. A direct route for the network 192.168.99.0/24
#	2. A network route via the node "RouterAC" for the network 10.99.0.254/16
#	3. A network route via the node "RouterAC" for the network 172.16.99.0/24
#	4. A default route via the node "Gateway"  for all the rest (relevant to Task 2)

ifconfig eth0 up
/etc/init.d/networking start

#configure eth0 IP address and subnet mask
ifconfig eth0  192.168.99.1/24

#we expect the above command to also add a direct route for all the nodes in 192.168.99.0/24

#so now we only need to specify how we can access the other networks
#to access the nodes in 10.99.0.0/16 we need as gateway the node "routerAC"
route add -net 10.99.0.0/16 gw 192.168.99.3 dev eth0 

#to access the nodes in 172.16.99.0/24 we need as gateway the node "routerBC"
route add -net 172.16.99.0/24 gw 192.168.99.4 dev eth0 

#to access all the rest of internet we need a default route through the node "Gateway"
route add default gw 192.168.99.254


#Let's print the interface configuration and our routing table
