ifconfig eth0 up

#configure eth0 IP address and subnet mask
ifconfig eth0  172.16.99.2/24

#we expect the above command to also add a direct route for all the nodes in 172.16.99.0/24

#so now we only need to specify how we can access the other networks
#since all the rest of the networks are accessible through routerBC we need one more rule:
route add default gw 172.16.99.254 dev eth0
