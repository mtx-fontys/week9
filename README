I configured some nodes using ".startup" files, and some using "etc/network/interfaces", so that you can compare the two alternative ways.  
PC1A,PC1B,PC1C,RouterAC, and Gateway are configured using the .startup files. For the purpose of our course this is ok.
PC2A,PC2B,PC2C,and RouterBC are configured using the etc/network/interfaces. In a real scenario this would be the prefered approach.

All then nodes are configured so that all the extenal IP addresses(hence 8.8.8.8) are accessible
However, the fact that we have routing rules for all destinations, does not mean that we are done
For that, we need to guarantee that incoming traffic will also be routed properly
When we ping 8.8.8.8 from the "Gateway" virtual machine, the packets go and return successfully.
However we try from any other virtual machine, we notice that the packets stop at the host (we can use tcpdump on the host computer to verify)
Therefore, we need to make sure that the host computer also has the necessary routing rules so that the packets to reach our network
This can be done with two approaches:
	We can use on the host computer the command "sudo route add -net" for each of our networks (e.g. 10.99.0.0/16, 192.168.99.0/24, and 172.16.99.0/24) and use as gateway our "Gateway"'s IP address 192.168.200.1
	This is what is implemented in the file "setup-external". Just run from your host computer terminal after the network starts "./setup-external", and you are good to go.
	This method is a method that needs only "route" and no extra knowledge, so this is what I was expecting you to do.
	However, this is kind of a "hack", as it implies in a real world scenario that we have access to the routers outside our adminstrative domain (e.g. to our ISP's infrastructure).
	In real world, this is not the case. In real world (for example the routers you have at home) we use NAT (network address translation). 
	We will talk more about NAT it in the advanced phase. Anyways this is implemented by the second approach in "Gateway.startup"(my default choice, so you can disable it to try the 1st approach).

I have also made a script to test the connectivity. You can run this script in any of the virtual machines by running the command "/hostlab/./test-routes"
