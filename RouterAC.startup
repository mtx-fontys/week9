#Therefore we can tell that RouterAC needs:
#	1. A direct route for the network 10.99.0.0/16 on eth0
#	2. A direct route for the network 192.168.99.0/24 on eth1
#	3. A network route via the node RouterBC for the network 172.16.99.0/24 
#	4. A default route via the node Gateway for all the rest (relevant to Task 2)

#we expect the above commands to also add a direct route for all the nodes in 10.99.0.0/16 and  another direct route for all the nodes in 192.168.99.0/24

#to access the nodes in 172.16.99.0/24 we need a route via the gateway node RouterBC
